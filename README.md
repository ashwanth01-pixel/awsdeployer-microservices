## 1. Overview: Microservices Architecture

Your project is organized into several microservices, each in its own folder (and, as you note, in production each would be in its own repo). The main microservices are:

- **AUTODEPLOY-MICROSERVICE**
- **AWS-CB-MICROSERVICE**
- **HISTORY-SERVICE-MICROSERVICE**
- **INFRA-ONECLICK**
- **MONITOR-LOGS-MICROSERVICE**

Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain or functionality, and they communicate over the network (typically via REST APIs or messaging).

---

## 2. Microservice Breakdown

### AUTODEPLOY-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Automates deployment of applications, likely to AWS or Kubernetes.
- **Backend:** Python (see `deployer/app.py`), with dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- **Frontend:** Static files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`).
- **Kubernetes Manifests:** For deployment, HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), network policies, RBAC, and services.
- **Docker:** Custom Dockerfile for containerization.

### AWS-CB-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Likely handles AWS CodeBuild or similar CI/CD tasks.
- **Backend:** Python (`backend/app.py`).
- **Frontend:** Static files in `frontend/`.
- **Login Module:** React app (`login/` with `App.js`, etc.).
- **Kubernetes Manifests:** Similar structure for deployment, HPA, network, RBAC, and services.
- **Docker:** Dockerfile for backend.

### HISTORY-SERVICE-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Manages historical data, possibly for audit or logs.
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot, see `pom.xml`, `src/main/`).
- **Database:** Embedded database files in `data/`.
- **Kubernetes Manifests:** For deployment, HPA, RBAC, and services.
- **Docker:** Dockerfile for Java service.

### INFRA-ONECLICK

- **Purpose:** Infrastructure provisioning, possibly for setting up namespaces, ingress, persistent volumes, etc.
- **Scripts:** Shell script (`script.sh`) for automation.
- **Kubernetes Manifests:** Namespace, ingress, persistent volume.

### MONITOR-LOGS-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Log monitoring and aggregation.
- **Backend:** Python (`database/app.py`).
- **Database:** Models and requirements in `database/`.
- **Kubernetes Manifests:** For deployment, HPA, network, RBAC, secrets, services, statefulset.

---

## 3. How the System Works

- **Each microservice is independently developed, built, and deployed.**
- **Communication:** Services interact via APIs (HTTP/REST) or message queues.
- **Deployment:** Each service is containerized (Docker) and deployed to Kubernetes using its own manifests.
- **Scaling:** HPA is used for auto-scaling based on load.
- **Security:** Network policies and RBAC are used for secure communication and access control.
- **Frontend:** Some services have their own frontend (static or React), others are backend-only.

---

## 4. Getting Started as a Beginner

1. **Clone the Repositories:**  
   Each microservice will be in its own repo. Clone the ones you want to work on.

2. **Set Up Prerequisites:**  
   - Install Docker, kubectl, and minikube or access to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - For Python services: Install Python 3.x and pip.
   - For Java services: Install JDK and Maven.
   - For React frontend: Install Node.js and npm.

3. **Install Dependencies:**  
   - Python: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Java: `mvn clean install`
   - React: `npm install` in the `login/` directory.

4. **Build Docker Images:**  
   - Run `docker build -t <service-name>:latest .` in each backend directory.

5. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**  
   - Apply manifests: `kubectl apply -f k8s/` in each service.

6. **Access the Services:**  
   - Use `kubectl port-forward` or set up ingress as per INFRA-ONECLICK.

---

## 5. Tools Used

- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript (React)
- **Frameworks:** Flask (Python), Spring Boot (Java), React (JS)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (manifests for deployment, HPA, RBAC, etc.)
- **CI/CD:** Likely AWS CodeBuild or similar (based on naming)
- **Database:** Embedded DB for Java, possibly SQLite or similar for Python
- **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/JS, React
- **Automation:** Shell scripts

---

## 6. Best Practices Followed

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each microservice has a single responsibility.
- **Containerization:** All services are dockerized for consistency and portability.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Kubernetes manifests and shell scripts for reproducible environments.
- **Scaling:** HPA for automatic scaling.
- **Security:** Network policies and RBAC for access control.
- **Version Control:** Each service in its own repo for modular development.
- **Frontend/Backend Separation:** Clear separation for maintainability.

---

## 7. DevOps Best Practices (with Examples from Your Project)

1. **Microservice Isolation:**  
   Each service is independently deployable and scalable.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   Use AWS CodeBuild or GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deploy.

3. **Containerization:**  
   Dockerfiles for each service ensure consistent environments.

4. **Kubernetes Manifests:**  
   - **Deployment:** Declarative deployment of services.
   - **HPA:** Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory.
   - **RBAC:** Fine-grained access control.
   - **Network Policies:** Restrict traffic between pods for security.
   - **Secrets Management:** Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data.

5. **Monitoring & Logging:**  
   - Centralized logging (MONITOR-LOGS-MICROSERVICE).
   - Use of statefulsets for persistent log storage.

6. **Infrastructure as Code:**  
   - All infra (namespace, ingress, PV) is defined as code for reproducibility.

7. **Automated Testing:**  
   - Unit and integration tests in each service (not shown, but recommended).

8. **Documentation:**  
   - README files in each service for onboarding.

9. **Versioning:**  
   - Use of `GIT_SHA.txt` for tracking deployed versions.

10. **Environment Parity:**  
    - Use of Docker and Kubernetes ensures dev/prod parity.

## 8. How to Structure Repos in an Organization

- Each microservice is a separate repo:  
  e.g., `org/AUTODEPLOY-MICROSERVICE`, `org/AWS-CB-MICROSERVICE`, etc.
- Shared libraries or common code can be in their own repo.
- Use organization-level secrets and CI/CD pipelines for consistency.
- Use a mono-repo for manifests/scripts if needed, or keep infra in a separate repo.

---

## 9. Final Tips for Beginners

- Start with one microservice, get it running locally, then move to Docker and Kubernetes.
- Read the README and code comments for each service.
- Use VS Code with Docker and Kubernetes extensions for easier development.
- Learn basic kubectl and Docker commands.
- Follow the structure and best practices already present in the project.

## 3. How the System Works (End-to-End)

1. **Development:**  
   Each microservice is developed independently, with its own codebase, dependencies, and documentation.

2. **Containerization:**  
   Each service has a Dockerfile. The code is packaged into a Docker image, ensuring consistency across environments.

3. **Infrastructure as Code:**  
   All Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, HPA, RBAC, network policies, secrets) are defined as YAML manifests. This makes the infrastructure reproducible and version-controlled.

4. **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   (Implied by naming and structure) Each repo can have its own pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, AWS CodeBuild) to automate:
   - Linting and testing
   - Building Docker images
   - Pushing images to a registry
   - Deploying to Kubernetes

5. **Deployment:**  
   - Use `kubectl apply -f k8s/` to deploy each service.
   - HPA ensures services scale based on demand.
   - Network policies and RBAC enforce security.

6. **Monitoring & Logging:**  
   - MONITOR-LOGS-MICROSERVICE aggregates logs.
   - StatefulSets and persistent volumes ensure log data is durable.

7. **Access & Frontend:**  
   - Some services expose web UIs (static or React).
   - Ingress and services manage external/internal access.
